This is my copy of the starter code for the worldwide content version of CSE 210.

This repository contains the starter code for many different projects. They are arranged as follows:

* `sandbox` - An empty project that you can use to play around with any concepts you like.
* `csharp-prep` - Starter projects for each of the C# Prep assignments.
* `prepare` - Starter projects for each of the preparation Learning Activities.
* `prove` - Starter projects for each of the prove Developer projects.
* `foundation` - Starter projects for foundation projects.

I hope this functions as a valuable start to understanding GitHub.
